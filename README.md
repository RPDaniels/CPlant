This software shows graphically the relationships between plants, in order to design ecosystems that are sustainable and symbiotic. This software is still under development and is aimed to be a part of an open source permaculture software.

The program contains two frames:
Left frame : Allows you to choose a plant from the plant catalog and add it to an ecosystem. Left click over a plant will show the companions. Right click will add the plant to the ecosystem. This way we can form a set of plants (ecosystem) and see the relationships they contain
  
Right frame: Shows the beneficial or harmful relationships between plants of the ecosystem. A green line indicates a beneficial relationship, while a red line indicates a detrimental relationship for the plant. A description of the relationships (couples of plants) of the formed ecosystem will display.

The program also allows to show recommended plants for any formed ecosystem or plants that could harm the ecosystem.
