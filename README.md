# CPlant
A visualizer of companion plants relationships made with Python and SQLite

This software shows graphically the relationships between plants, in order to design ecosystems that are sustainable and symbiotic.

The program contains two frames:
Left frame : Allows you to choose a plant from the catalog and add it to an ecosystem. Left click will show the companions. Right click will add the plant to the ecosystem.
  
Right frame: Shows the beneficial or harmful relationships between plants of the ecosystem. A green line indicates a beneficial relationship, while a red line indicates a detrimental relationship for the plant.
